This is a [Botium](https://github.com/codeforequity-at/botium-core) connector for testing your [Whatsapp Business API Webhooks](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/webhooks).

__Did you read the [Botium in a Nutshell](https://medium.com/@floriantreml/botium-in-a-nutshell-part-1-overview-f8d0ceaf8fb4) articles ? Be warned, without prior knowledge of Botium you won't be able to properly use this library!__

## How it worksÂ ?
Botium emulates the [Whatsapp Business API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp)
* It sends inbound messages to your webhook
* It listens for outbound messages from your webhook

__Redis__ is used to connect the webhook to Botium scripts: all messages received over the webhook are published to Redis, and Botium on the other end subscribes to those Redis channels before running a conversation. 

It can be used as any other Botium connector with all Botium Stack components:
* [Botium CLI](https://github.com/codeforequity-at/botium-cli/)
* [Botium Bindings](https://github.com/codeforequity-at/botium-bindings/)
* [Botium Box](https://www.botium.at)

## Requirements

* __Node.js and NPM__
* a __Whatsapp Business API Webhook__
* a __Redis__ instance (Cloud hosted free tier for example from [redislabs](https://redislabs.com/) will do as a starter)
* a __project directory__ on your workstation to hold test cases and Botium configuration

## Install Botium and Whatsapp Connector

When using __Botium CLI__:

```
> npm install -g botium-cli
> npm install -g botium-connector-whatsapp
> cd <your working dir>
> botium-cli init
> botium-cli run
```

When using __Botium Bindings__:

```
> npm install -g botium-bindings
> npm install -g botium-connector-whatsapp
> botium-bindings init mocha
> npm install && npm run mocha
```

When using __Botium Box__:

_Already integrated into Botium Box, no setup required_

## Connecting your Whatsapp Webhook to Botium

Open the file _botium.json_ in your working directory and add the webhook url and Redis connection settings.

```
{
  "botium": {
    "Capabilities": {
      "PROJECTNAME": "<whatever>",
      "CONTAINERMODE": "whatsapp",
      "WHATSAPP_WEBHOOKURL": "...",
      "SIMPLEREST_INBOUND_REDISURL": "redis://127.0.0.1:6379"
    }
  }
}
```
Botium setup is ready, you can begin to write your [BotiumScript](https://github.com/codeforequity-at/botium-core/wiki/Botium-Scripting) files.

__Important: The `inbound-proxy` command has to be started with Botium CLI. Otherwise, Botium scripts will fail to receive any input or output messages from your chatbot!__

## Running the Samples

Install botium-core as peerDependency 

    > npm install --no-save botium-core

Afterwards in the folder _samples/whatsapp-echo-bot_ is an example for a simple Whatsapp Webhook chatbot - it is connected to a **I Am Botium** chatbot endpoint doing some simple smalltalk. Start the webhook:

    > cd samples/whatsapp-echo-bot && npm install && npm start
    
Finally, navigate into the samples/simple and run `npm install`, start the inbound proxy server 
and run the test itself with the following commands:

     > cd samples/simple
     > npm install
     > npm run inbound
     > npm test

## Supported Capabilities

Set the capability __CONTAINERMODE__ to __whatsapp__ to activate this connector.

### WHATSAPP_WEBHOOKURL

### WHATSAPP_RECIPIENTID

Optional. By default, a unique id is generated.
